# List of known bugs     
●	Once the users chatting click on the hyperlink and navigate to the appropriate page, the chat will disappear and once the user clicks on it again, it will be restored.   
●	When the ticker is open and the user clicks on ‘Mark as completed’, the completion is not updated. It has to be done only when the ticker is closed/hidden.
